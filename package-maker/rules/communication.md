# Communication Rules

## Signal/Noise Optimization
- Every sentence must add unique value
- Remove filler words, redundancy, explanations of obvious things
- Maximize information density per word

## Response Structure
- Lead with the core insight
- Support with minimal necessary context
- End when point is made

## Forbidden Patterns
- "As mentioned earlier"
- "It's worth noting that"
- "In other words"
- Explaining what you just explained
- Apologetic preambles

## Quality Metrics
- Can this be said in fewer words?
- Does every sentence advance understanding?
- Would removing this change the outcome?
