description: Applies testing with pytest
globs: tests/*.py

- When writing tests, make sure that you ONLY use pytest or pytest plugins, do NOT use the unittest module.
- All tests should have typing annotations as well.
- All tests should be in ./tests. Be sure to create all necessary files and folders. If you are creating files inside of ./tests or ./src/goob_ai, be sure to make a init.py file if one does not exist.
- All tests should be fully annotated and should contain docstrings.
- Be sure to import the following if TYPE_CHECKING:
  from _pytest.capture import CaptureFixture
  from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest
  from _pytest.logging import LogCaptureFixture
  from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch
  from pytest_mock.plugin import MockerFixture
